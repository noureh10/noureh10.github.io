Hello stranger ! 

On this small article, you'll find everything to know about what to expect from this platform. Let's talk about the main subjects that will be treated here

##### Curriculum Vitae

If you came to check my skills and competences, you're on the spot ! You'll find a short yet informative Curriculum Vitae on my website.

##### Programming

"Why should a human do it if a machine can achieve it" is perhaps one of my favorite quote
when talking about programming in general. On this website, you'll find some of my projects and documentation related to it. I'll also report on some problems that I encountered.

##### Domotics

I am fascinated by home automation and all the things you can achieve with the [Internet of Things](https://www.oracle.com/internet-of-things/what-is-iot/#:~:text=What%20is%20IoT%3F,and%20systems%20over%20the%20internet.) using platforms such as Raspberry PI. Here, you will find my projects to transform my house into a smart home.
