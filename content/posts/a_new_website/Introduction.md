Hello stranger ! 

On this small blog post, you'll find everything to know about what to expect from this platform. Let's talk about the main topics that will be covered here.

##### Programming

"Why should a human do it if a machine can achieve it" is perhaps one of my favorite quote
when talking about programming in general. On this website, you'll find some of my programming and automation projects and documentation related to it. I'll also report here about the problems encountered.

##### Tech news

New technology that I find interesting? You'll find it there.

##### Domotics

I am fascinated by home automation and all the things you can achieve with the [Internet of Things](https://www.oracle.com/internet-of-things/what-is-iot/#:~:text=What%20is%20IoT%3F,and%20systems%20over%20the%20internet.) using platforms such as Raspberry PI. Here, you will find my projects to transform my house into a smart home.

##### Tutorials

You'll also find a handful of diverese tutorials ranging from installing a software to fix a recurring bug and so on.
